A short link is a compact version of a long web address. It saves characters when space is limited, looks cleaner when shared, and is far easier to remember and pass along.

## Key Features

- **Compact long URLs** — turn a sprawling web address into a short, tidy link that's easy to share in messages, slides, or print.
- **Custom slugs** — pick your own memorable ending (e.g. `/my-portfolio`) instead of a random string of characters.
- **Instant redirect** — visiting the short link forwards to the original URL right away, with no intermediate page.
- **Persistent storage** — links are saved in MongoDB, so they keep working every time you share them.

## How to Use

To use it, enter your long URL:

```html
https://example.com/your/very/long/url/
```

Then, choose a slug for your shortened URL:

```html
https://url-to.vercel.app/<your-slug>
```

Click the compact button, and the tool will give you a shortened link that redirects to your URL.
